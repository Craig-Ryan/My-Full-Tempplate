# This is my first webpage

Welcome!

I created this page with whilst studying Git and Github in my fullstack web developers course with Code Institute.

Inside there are three HTML docs and a CSS doc for styling.

Inside each page there is at least 1 h1 heading, 6 styled image links which are interactive and will link users to a seperate page as well as links directing users to other pages within the project itself.

The idea behind this project was to practive my HTML and CSS skills and to learn about working with projects in Gitpod and learning the commands to enable my work to be pushed to Github.

All guidance was from Matt Rudge, teacher at Code Institute.
