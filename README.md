# This is my first webpage

Welcome!

I created this page with whilst studying Git and Github in my fullstack web developers course with Code Institute.

Inside there are three HTML docs, a CSS folder with a css style doc for styling and this README.md file with a description on the project's layout.

Inside each page there is a navbar for navigating between pages, a h1 heading, 6 styled image links which are interactive and will link users to a seperate page.

The idea behind this project was to practice my HTML and CSS skills and to learn about commands in Git, working with projects in Gitpod and learning the commands to enable my work to be pushed to Github.

All guidance was from Matt Rudge, teacher at Code Institute.
